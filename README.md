This library includes a comprehensive set of floating-point unit (FPU) designs, such as adders, subtractors, multipliers, dividers, and trigonometric function modules. 
All FPUs are fully parameterizable in terms of precision, pipeline depth, and iteration count, offering design flexibility and enhanced productivity for a broad range of applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum circuit emulation. 
In addition to basic operations, the library also provides complex FPUs and higher-level building blocks such as dot product and AXPY operations.
The design library is developed using Chisel, a hardware construction language (HCL). 
The generated SystemVerilog code is compatible with standard verification environments.
